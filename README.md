# Exercise 1.10.3 on Saavedra & Stouffer (2013)
# 1) Write a script that takes one of these files and determines the number of rows (pollinators) and columns (plants).

# Counting the number of rows amount to counting
# the number of lines. This is easily done with
# wc -l. For example:

wc -l ../data/Saavedra2013/n10.txt 

# Which returns 14 ../data/Saavedra2013/n10.txt

# To avoid printing the file name we can either use cat

cat ../data/Saavedra2013/n10.txt | wc -l
# 14

# or use the symbol < for the input

wc -l < ../data/Saavedra2013/n10.txt 
# 14

# Counting the number of columns is more work.
# First, we need only the first line:

head -n 1 ../data/Saavedra2013/n10.txt

# 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

# Now we can remove all spaces and the line terminator using tr:
head -n 1 ../data/Saavedra2013/n10.txt | tr -d ' ' | tr -d '\n'

# 01000001000000000100

# Finally, we can use wc -c to count the number of characters in the string:

head -n 1 ../data/Saavedra2013/n10.txt | tr -d ' ' | tr -d '\n' | wc -c
# 20

# Armed with this information, we can write our script (see the file netsize.sh).

# 2) Write a script that prints the number of rows and columns for each network

# This requires some commands that we haven't covered in the text. We put this example to show how many problems can be solved by searching the web for an answer. You don't need to remember all of the commands, but you need to be able to find solutions online!

# In a script, if you write:

FILES=../data/Saavedra2013/*.txt

# You create a list of all the .txt files in the "variable" FILES. You can then iterate through
# all the files in the directory with a "for" loop (more on this when we start programming).
# For example, a script with the line above and

for f in $FILES
do
    echo $f
done

# would print the file names in the directory.

# From the point above, you know how to determine
# the number of rows. You can store the result in
# another variable:

for f in $FILES
do
    myrow=`cat $f | wc -l`
    echo $f $myrow
done

# Note the use of backticks `: the syntax of bash is
# very finnicky, and you need to write the commands
# exactly as above.

$ bash netsize.sh ../data/Saavedra2013/n1.txt
Filename: ../data/Saavedra2013/n1.txt
Number of rows: 97
Number of columns: 80
